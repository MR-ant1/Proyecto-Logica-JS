# El Reparto de Empanadas
This is a recreation of a meet between geekshubs academy students, were they have to distribute "Empanadillas" in groups of three to take advantage of a 3X1 discount to save as money as possible. This is solved through a function explained below.

### FEATURES :bulb:

-Introduce any amount of empanadillas to be bought. The function throws the cheapest price for the asked combination

### POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS :heavy_check_mark: 

After many tries of reformulate the function to implement a bucle which combines al prices between them, the final method used to calculate the cheapest price has been a ponderated media that use each kind of Empanada's relative price (basing on each price) as a way to solve the combinations discounts deppending on each mix.
